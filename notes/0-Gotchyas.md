# Micro Front End Gotchyas!

Adding some peculiar issues noticed during development.

## When Plugin name and id are the same!

- Do not name the `id` in the html as the same variable in `moduleFederationPlugin` in the webpack. When the code is compiled the exported values are created as a global variable and the ids are also generated with the same varibale name during execution. So the file contents will be overwritten by the element if both are named the same.

Example:

Below are the sample `webpack.config.js` file and `Ã¬ndex.html` with the same plugin name and id which will cause issue.

```javascript
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');
const ModuleFederationPlugin = require('webpack/lib/container/ModuleFederationPlugin');
module.exports = {
  mode: 'development', 
  devServer: {
    port: 8082,
  },
  plugins: [
    new ModuleFederationPlugin({
      name: 'same-cart-name', // <--This name should not be same as id
      filename: `remoteEntry.js`,
      exposes: {
        './CartShow': './src/bootstrap',
      },
      shared: {
        faker: {
          singleton: true
        }
      }
    }),
    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
      template: './public/index.html',
    }),
  ],
};
```

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>ModuleFederation-Cart</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!--
    the id in the html should not be the same as the modulefederationplugin name 
     -->
    <div id="same-cart-name"></div>
</body>
</html>
```

## Handling CSS in Microfrontends

- may require major rewrite when using third party css libraries during version updates. For example updating from bootstrap v3 to v4. As it will require through testing and scoping for css identifiers.

- When pages are getting load the CSS with the same identifiers will take precedence in the order in which the MF loads the page.

- When using `css-in-js` with two or more projects using the same library, there is a chance that there will be a class name collision. This issue occurs when the two apps use the same class name and during the prod build the long css names are minified.

## Browser history to memory history and vice-versa

Some links will have to be clicked twice inorder for it to load if not handled properly.
